00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.350
There was a person who ordained as a monk in Buddhism and went to ask Lord Buddha about it.

2
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.340
What are the duties of a monk after ordination? Lord Buddha said that a monk has two duties.

3
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.460
First, study the Dhamma and teach meditation.

4
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.910
He asked what the Dhamma was and the various elements of love. It means studying scriptures, ordination, and learning

5
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.030
What to study? Study the Tripitaka.

6
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.160
The second duty is meditation.

7
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.610
It means applying the knowledge learned from the Tripitaka.

8
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.000
Examine the body and its impermanence.

9
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.110
The untruthfulness of the body.

10
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.090
So that the mind doesn't cling to the body.

11
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.920
These are the two duties of a monk.

12
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.970
Now, there are two types of meditation study: the meditation season has two

13
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.840
One is called Samatha Kammatthana.

14
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.440
The second is called Vipassana Kammatthana.

15
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.080
Samatha Kammatthana means studying to bring about mental peace.

16
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.410
That is, the human mind is confused, restless, and overthinking. We think about various things every day, and we think

17
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.990
Too much. From the moment we wake up until we fall asleep.

18
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.780
Sometimes even dreaming continues, with that punch.

19
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.590
The content of the method, how not to make the mind so that it can be calm.

20
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.430
He taught to develop concentration.

21
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.960
When the mind becomes peaceful, continue to cultivate it. Use that peacefulness as a foundation, as a mental state.

22
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.350
Then contemplate and see deeper than that.

23
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.340
Look and see that our body is not constant, it is suffering, and it cannot find a state of self.

24
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.350
Once you understand this, it is said that this is the attainment of Dharma.

25
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.220
But today, we will talk about meditation, cultivating Dharma, and sometimes,

26
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.110
In the Buddha's time, he used the term "cultivating the Dharma".

27
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.170
Nowadays, we use the term "cultivating meditation".

28
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.980
Why do we need to cultivate meditation?

29
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.200
The reason we need to cultivate meditation is that our mind is definitely chaotic, agitated, and restless.

30
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.090
The speaker compared our mind to a monkey, which is very hyperactive. When a monkey is released in a house, it destroys the house!

31
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.560
In the end, it wreaks havoc in the garden, tearing flowers and leaves apart. That is the story of the monkey.

32
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.620
The speaker then compares our restless mind to a monkey.

33
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.270
But the question is, why do we need to practice meditation? We need to train the monkey to obey.

34
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.180
Why do we need to practice meditation? We need to practice meditation because our mind needs to be trained to be still. This is the

35
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.950
reason why we need to practice and be still, and how it is beneficial. When we are still, we can see

36
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.220
the truth of all things within ourselves. We will see the impermanence of everything.

37
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.320
The term "seeing the impermanence of everything" does not mean seeing because someone else told us, but seeing because we

38
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.390
have been taught to see.

39
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.740
With one's own mind, because peace arises, wisdom arises due to vipassana (insight meditation). That's it.

40
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.420
Then, one will truly see the peace and chaos and understand that everything is impermanent.

41
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.320
Everything is anicca (impermanent), dukkha (suffering), and anatta (non-self). The term anicca means not lasting, the term dukkha means unable to endure.

42
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.820
In the same condition, the term anatta means it cannot find its true self, even this table.

43
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.520
One day, it will have to break down and become something else. If it burns, it turns into ashes.

44
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:17.630
Ultimately, it returns to the natural law. That's the anatta of all phenomena.

45
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.690
There is a question of why we should develop concentration, because our minds are confused and chaotic.

46
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.130
The mind struggles, it swings and wavers. The mind is like a restless palace.

47
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.180
It swings and wavers, and the mind's thread is not peaceful. Because the mind is not peaceful, we have suffering.

48
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:45.400
To extinguish suffering, we must develop the foundation of actions or train the mind, or we must develop concentration and meditation.

49
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.420
Wishful thinking.
